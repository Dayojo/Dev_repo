# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)

## LEMP (Linux, Engine X (NGINX), MySQL, PHP)

- We need an AWS account

- launch a new EC2 instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

- Private key (.PEM file) should be saved securely and spin up the instance

- Connecting to EC2 terminal

  - Using the terminal on MAC/Linux

  - Using Windows Terminal

  - We'll be connecting to the EC2 instance using Gitbash terminal installed in my windows system
  
- We'll be needing our saved PEM key file change directory to download folder

- Run this command to ensure your key is not publicly viewable

  `chmod 400 <your-PEM-file-name>.pem`

- I will utilize the ssh protocol to establish a connection between my local terminal and my EC2 server

  `ssh -i <private-key-name>. pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>`

- Type `yes` to connect

- Now we are connected to our instance well done ðŸŽ‰

## Step 1 Installing the Nginx Web Server

- `sudo apt update`

- `sudo apt install nginx` 
- When prompted, enter `Y` to confirm that you want to install Nginx

- To confirm that nginx has been installed correctly and is functioning as a service on Ubuntu. 

- Run: `sudo systemctl status nginx`

If it is green and running, then you did everything correctly

- As we know, we have TCP port 22 open by default on our EC2 machine to access it via SSH, so we need to add a rule to EC2 configuration to open inbound connection through port 80: Our server is running and we can access it locally and from the Internet (Source 0.0.0.0/0 means â€˜from any IP addressâ€™). First, let us try to check how we can access it locally in our Ubuntu shell

- Run: `curl http://localhost:80`

- Let's test if our Nginx server can respond to requests from the Internet

Open a web browser of your choice and try to access following url `http://<EcintancePublic-IP-Address>:80`

If you see following page, then your web server is now correctly installed and accessible through your firewall.


## STEP 2 INSTALLING MYSQL

- To acquire and install this software:

`sudo apt install mysql-server` 
when promted type `yes`

- When the installation is finished, log in to the MySQL console by typing:

`sudo mysql`

- Before running the script, you will set a password for the root user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. Weâ€™re defining this userâ€™s password as PassWord.1 `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';`

Exit the MySQL shell with:

mysql> `exit`

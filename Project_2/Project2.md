# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)

## LEMP (Linux, Engine X (NGINX), MySQL, PHP)

- We need an AWS account

- launch a new EC2 instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

- Private key (.PEM file) should be saved securely and spin up the instance

- Connecting to EC2 terminal

  - Using the terminal on MAC/Linux

  - Using Windows Terminal

  - We'll be connecting to the EC2 instance using Gitbash terminal installed in my windows system
  
- We'll be needing our saved PEM key file change directory to download folder

- Run this command to ensure your key is not publicly viewable

  `chmod 400 <your-PEM-file-name>.pem`

- I will utilize the ssh protocol to establish a connection between my local terminal and my EC2 server

  `ssh -i <private-key-name>. pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>`

- Type `yes` to connect

- Now we are connected to our instance well done ðŸŽ‰

## Step 1 Installing the Nginx Web Server

- `sudo apt update` 
![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235178553-a166c566-1577-4383-87fd-dc3aee92a725.PNG)

- `sudo apt install nginx` 
- When prompted, enter `Y` to confirm that you want to install Nginx


![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235178761-02c92412-b825-4458-bbae-9751b9d84d37.jpg)


- To confirm that nginx has been installed correctly and is functioning as a service on Ubuntu. 

- Run: `sudo systemctl status nginx`

If it is green and running, then you did everything correctly

- As we know, we have TCP port 22 open by default on our EC2 machine to access it via SSH, so we need to add a rule to EC2 configuration to open inbound connection through port 80: Our server is running and we can access it locally and from the Internet (Source 0.0.0.0/0 means â€˜from any IP addressâ€™). First, let us try to check how we can access it locally in our Ubuntu shell

- Run: `curl http://localhost:80`

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235179975-ab92a830-22a0-4b97-8cf5-0608f6b532ff.jpg)

- Let's test if our Nginx server can respond to requests from the Internet

Open a web browser of your choice and try to access following url `http://<EcintancePublic-IP-Address>:80`

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235182576-22ca64ed-aaf8-4e80-8227-9c66528ad6bb.PNG)

If you see following page, then your web server is now correctly installed and accessible through your firewall.


## STEP 2 INSTALLING MYSQL

- To acquire and install this software:

`sudo apt install mysql-server` 
when promted type `yes`

- When the installation is finished, log in to the MySQL console by typing:

`sudo mysql`

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235184723-9157a0aa-1906-4d87-b4b1-0c7e872d3168.jpg)

- Before running the script, you will set a password for the root user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. Weâ€™re defining this userâ€™s password as PassWord.1 `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';`

Exit the MySQL shell with:

mysql> `exit`

Start the interactive script by running:

`sudo mysql_secure_installation`

This will ask if you want to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN.

Answer `Y` for yes, or anything else to continue without enabling.

![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235187868-ffdb7413-1ab2-4a4c-913c-39b1f0fcb7f2.jpg)

Let's test if we are able to log in to the MySQL console by typing: `sudo mysql -p`
Notice the -p flag in this command, which will prompt you for the password used after changing the root user password.

Exit the MySQL console, type: mysql> `exit` Notice that you need to provide a password to connect as the root user.

## STEP 3 INSTALLING PHP

- To process PHP requests, it's necessary to set up php-fpm, an acronym for "PHP fastCGI process manager", and configure Nginx to route them to this program. Moreover, you'll require php-mysql, a PHP extension that facilitates communication with databases based on MySQL. The fundamental PHP packages will be automatically installed as dependencies.

 - To install these 2 packages at once, run:

`sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql`

When prompted, type `Y` and press ENTER to confirm installation. You now have your PHP components installed. Next, you will configure Nginx to use them.

## STEP 4 CONFIGURING NGINX TO USE PHP PROCESSOR

- Nginx web server allows us to create server blocks that act like virtual hosts in Apache, enabling us to compartmentalize configuration details and support multiple domains on a single server. To illustrate this concept, we will use the domain name "project LEMP" in this guide.

- Create the root web directory for your domain as follows:
`sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP`

- Let's assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user:
`sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP`

- Then, open a new configuration file in Nginxâ€™s sites-available directory using your preferred command-line editor. Here, weâ€™ll use nano:
`sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP`

paste this:
```
#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}

```

When youâ€™re done editing, save and close the file. If youâ€™re using nano, you can do so by typing: CTRL+X and then y and ENTER to confirm.

- Activate your configuration by linking to the config file from Nginxâ€™s sites-enabled directory:

`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

This will tell Nginx to use the configuration next time it is reloaded. You can test your configuration for syntax errors by typing:

`sudo nginx -t`

You shall see following message:

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235194647-e79f0522-647c-4545-8e5b-53c6e765f38a.jpg)

- If you receive any error messages, you should revisit your configuration file and check its contents before proceeding further. In addition, you must deactivate the default Nginx host that is presently set to use port 80. To accomplish this, execute the following command:

`sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

- Let's reload Nginx to apply the changes:

`sudo systemctl reload nginx`

- The website is up and running now, but the web root directory located at /var/www/projectLEMP is still empty. To ensure that your new server block is functioning correctly, We will create an index.html file in that directory using the following command:

`sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html`

Now go to your browser and try to open your website URL using IP address: `http://<EcintancePublic-IP-Address>:80`

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235366448-679f2aab-289d-41f6-8af5-95b083da3824.PNG)

The "echo" command we used to write to the index.html file was successful, indicating that our Nginx site is working correctly.

Next, let's attempt to access the website using the DNS name by navigating to the following URL in a web browser:

`http://<InstancePublicPublic-DNS-Name>:80`

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235366570-935c81d7-6ef9-41b2-9bd1-1c93dfd0ad16.PNG)

- Your LEMP stack is now fully configured. In the next step, weâ€™ll create a PHP script to test that Nginx is in fact able to handle .php files within your newly configured website.

## STEP 5 TESTING PHP WITH NGINX

Open a new file called info.php within your document root in your text editor:
`sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php`

Type or paste the following lines into the new file. This is valid PHP code that will return information about your server:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```

![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235366894-b7b3269a-0973-49db-b01d-cc5a7504e791.PNG)

You can now access this page in your web browser by visiting the domain name or public IP address youâ€™ve set up in your Nginx configuration file, followed by /info.php:

`http://server_domain_or_IP/info.php`

![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235366987-a319a32d-c4c9-45d1-b0e1-ff2aebe6af21.PNG)

## STEP 6 Retrieving data from MySQL database with PHP

In this step we will create a test database (DB) with simple "To do list" and configure access to it, so the Nginx website would be able to query data from the DB and display it.

We will create a database named example_database and a user named example_user, but you can replace these names with different values.

First, connect to the MySQL console using the root account:
`sudo mysql`

![15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235367553-c02ffbc0-8788-41d2-8a8f-a5333dc19dec.jpg)

- Lets create a new database, run the following command from your MySQL console:

`CREATE DATABASE example_database;`

- Now we can create a new user and grant him full privileges on the database we have just created.

`CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';`

![16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235367799-eaaa06f2-d062-4f9c-aee9-3425be5f2ea7.PNG)

The following command above creates a new user named example_user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. Weâ€™re defining this userâ€™s password as password, but you should replace this value with a secure password of your own choosing.

- Now we need to give this user permission over the example_database database:

`GRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'%';`

![17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235367992-81700301-7a54-416e-92c7-09475154bf57.PNG)

This will give the example_user user full privileges over the example_database database, while preventing this user from creating or modifying other databases on your server.

Now exit the MySQL shell with: `exit`

- Lets test if the new user has the proper permissions by logging in to the MySQL console again, this time using the custom user credentials:
`mysql -u example_user -p`

![18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235368097-14d01543-31a9-4c07-81cc-a5c9d7893d8c.PNG)

- Notice the -p flag in this command, which will prompt us for the password used when creating the example_user user. After logging in to the MySQL console, confirm that you have access to the example_database database: mysql> `SHOW DATABASES;`

This will give you the following output:

![19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235368386-b89afe82-4247-454a-8d69-bff0f29d85c9.PNG)

- Now lets create a test table named todo_list. From the MySQL console, run the following statement:

```
CREATE TABLE example_database.todo_list (
mysql> 	item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
mysql> 	content VARCHAR(255),
mysql> 	PRIMARY KEY(item_id)
mysql> );
```

![20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235368577-22acc3bc-b2a0-4b50-b4f9-a21e254b1e66.PNG)

You might want to repeat the next command a few times, using different VALUES:

`INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");`

![21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235368733-69c17daf-e385-4b43-9560-6539f8cc8017.PNG)

- To confirm that the data was successfully saved to your table, run: `SELECT * FROM` `example_database.todo_list;`

We should see the following output:

![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235368844-919b0bd6-9623-4831-9c30-8940bec4d40d.PNG)

- After confirming that you have valid data in your test table, you can exit the MySQL console: mysql> `exit`

Now you can create a PHP script that will connect to MySQL and query for your content. Create a new PHP file in your custom web root directory using your preferred editor. Weâ€™ll use nano editor for that: 
`nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php`

The following PHP script connects to the MySQL database and queries for the content of the todo_list table, displays the results in a list. If there is a problem with the database connection, it will throw an exception. Copy this content into your todo_list.php script:

```
<?php
$user = "example_user";
$password = "PassWord.1";
$database = "example_database";
$table = "todo_list";

try {
$db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
}
echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}

```

![23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235369002-155a6d13-4ef7-4c6f-adee-f86fd309c04d.PNG)

Save and close the file when you are done editing.

You can now access this page in your web browser by visiting the domain name or public IP address configured for your website, followed by /todo_list.php:

`http://<Public_domain_or_IP>/todo_list.php`

You should see a page like this, showing the content youâ€™ve inserted in your test table:

![24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235369067-62f39f83-48a2-48e2-80e8-b19efc1d6023.PNG)

## OR

## Now terminate your instance and any other resources to avoid additional charges

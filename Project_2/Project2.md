# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)

## LEMP (Linux, Engine X (NGINX), MySQL, PHP)

- We need an AWS account

- launch a new EC2 instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

- Private key (.PEM file) should be saved securely and spin up the instance

- Connecting to EC2 terminal

  - Using the terminal on MAC/Linux

  - Using Windows Terminal

  - We'll be connecting to the EC2 instance using Gitbash terminal installed in my windows system
  
- We'll be needing our saved PEM key file change directory to download folder

- Run this command to ensure your key is not publicly viewable

  `chmod 400 <your-PEM-file-name>.pem`

- I will utilize the ssh protocol to establish a connection between my local terminal and my EC2 server

  `ssh -i <private-key-name>. pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>`

- Type `yes` to connect

- Now we are connected to our instance well done ðŸŽ‰

## Step 1 Installing the Nginx Web Server

- `sudo apt update`

- `sudo apt install nginx` 
- When prompted, enter `Y` to confirm that you want to install Nginx

- To confirm that nginx has been installed correctly and is functioning as a service on Ubuntu. 

- Run: `sudo systemctl status nginx`

If it is green and running, then you did everything correctly

- As we know, we have TCP port 22 open by default on our EC2 machine to access it via SSH, so we need to add a rule to EC2 configuration to open inbound connection through port 80: Our server is running and we can access it locally and from the Internet (Source 0.0.0.0/0 means â€˜from any IP addressâ€™). First, let us try to check how we can access it locally in our Ubuntu shell

- Run: `curl http://localhost:80`

- Let's test if our Nginx server can respond to requests from the Internet

Open a web browser of your choice and try to access following url `http://<EcintancePublic-IP-Address>:80`

If you see following page, then your web server is now correctly installed and accessible through your firewall.


## STEP 2 INSTALLING MYSQL

- To acquire and install this software:

`sudo apt install mysql-server` 
when promted type `yes`

- When the installation is finished, log in to the MySQL console by typing:

`sudo mysql`

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123396933/235184723-9157a0aa-1906-4d87-b4b1-0c7e872d3168.jpg)

- Before running the script, you will set a password for the root user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. Weâ€™re defining this userâ€™s password as PassWord.1 `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';`

Exit the MySQL shell with:

mysql> `exit`

Start the interactive script by running:

`sudo mysql_secure_installation`

This will ask if you want to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN.

Answer `Y` for yes, or anything else to continue without enabling.

Let's test if we are able to log in to the MySQL console by typing: `sudo mysql -p`
Notice the -p flag in this command, which will prompt you for the password used after changing the root user password.

Exit the MySQL console, type: mysql> `exit` Notice that you need to provide a password to connect as the root user.

## STEP 3 INSTALLING PHP

- To process PHP requests, it's necessary to set up php-fpm, an acronym for "PHP fastCGI process manager", and configure Nginx to route them to this program. Moreover, you'll require php-mysql, a PHP extension that facilitates communication with databases based on MySQL. The fundamental PHP packages will be automatically installed as dependencies.

 - To install these 2 packages at once, run:

`sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql`

When prompted, type `Y` and press ENTER to confirm installation. You now have your PHP components installed. Next, you will configure Nginx to use them.

## STEP 4 CONFIGURING NGINX TO USE PHP PROCESSOR

- Nginx web server allows us to create server blocks that act like virtual hosts in Apache, enabling us to compartmentalize configuration details and support multiple domains on a single server. To illustrate this concept, we will use the domain name "project LEMP" in this guide.

- Create the root web directory for your domain as follows:
`sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP`

- Let's assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user:
`sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP`

- Then, open a new configuration file in Nginxâ€™s sites-available directory using your preferred command-line editor. Here, weâ€™ll use nano:
`sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP`

paste this:

`#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP`

`server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;`

   `index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }`

`}`

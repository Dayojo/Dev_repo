# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)

## LEMP (Linux, Engine X (NGINX), MySQL, PHP)

- We need an AWS account

- launch a new EC2 instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

- Private key (.PEM file) should be saved securely and spin up the instance

- Connecting to EC2 terminal

  - Using the terminal on MAC/Linux

  - Using Windows Terminal

  - We'll be connecting to the EC2 instance using Gitbash terminal installed in my windows system

- Run this command to ensure your key is not publicly viewable

  `chmod 400 <your-PEM-file-name>.pem`

- I will utilize the ssh protocol to establish a connection between my local terminal and my EC2 server

  `ssh -i <private-key-name>. pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>`

- Type `yes` to connect

- Now we are connected to our instance well done ðŸŽ‰

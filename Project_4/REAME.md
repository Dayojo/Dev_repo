# DEPLOYING MEAN STACK TO UBUNTU EC2 INSTANCE IN AWS

## The MEAN Stack comprises a blend of the subsequent elements:

- MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows retrieval of data.
- Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
## In this assignment, you are going to implement a simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.

## Step 0 – Preparing prerequisites
